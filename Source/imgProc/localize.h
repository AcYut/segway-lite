/*
TECHNIQUE FOR LOCALIZATION:
Given - we have a probability distribution for position and orientation
Monte carlo - N random samples must be selected from this. Sample: position + orientation + its probability
From these N random samples, generate N more random samples based on the observations
Repeat

IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Select N random particles from distribution made up by last time's N particles (can't be the same ones!)
2. Apply motion model to these particles - for eg shift each of these particles in the direction moved or something
3. For each particle, find probability that this is the position according to landmarks observed. Multiply this to existing probability.
4. Repeat

PROBLEM: Is random sample selection dependent on PDF or not? 
ie are high probability points more likely to be selected in sampling, or is each point as likely as the other?

TODO: How to get a PDF from N random particles? We need this because:
1. We need to get the position from this thing (ob)
2. We need to get N random particles from this
Can this be achieved without explicitly generating a PDF? I think it can.

TODO: To prevent kidnap problem, some random particles need to be inserted(?)

TODO: Feature Detection:
1. Xs and Ts - Use schulz, current method is SLOW.
2. Landmark poles and goal posts - Current thing seems ok, maybe small modifications
3. Need to add line detection


PROBLEM: Kidnap problem happening. Need to sprinkle some random points each iteration
SOLUTION: Added 2% random points each iteration
